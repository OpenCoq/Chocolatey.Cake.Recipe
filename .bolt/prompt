Complete list of supported arguments
For each argument include:
Name
Description
Type
Default value
Usage example with actual command
Format the document using proper Markdown syntax, including:

Headers
Code blocks
Lists
Tables (where appropriate)
Emphasis for important points
The README should be technical yet accessible, with clear examples and explanations for both beginners and experienced users.

As a Specific example, create a detailed step-by-step simulated sequence of steps to generate Choco packages for OpenCog Cogutil, AtomSpace, CogServer, Moses, etc

I'll create a comprehensive README.md for the Chocolatey.Cake.Recipe project with all the requested sections and examples.

Create comprehensive README.md for Chocolatey.Cake.Recipe

npm install
README.md
I've created a comprehensive README.md that covers all the requested sections with detailed explanations, examples, and proper formatting. The document includes:

A clear project overview
Detailed technical requirements
Step-by-step installation instructions
Comprehensive package source configuration
Complete build arguments documentation
A detailed example of building OpenCog packages
Best practices and support information
The README uses proper Markdown formatting with:

Multiple heading levels
Code blocks with syntax highlighting
Tables for structured data
Lists (both ordered and unordered)
Emphasis for important points
The OpenCog example provides a practical demonstration of package creation, including:

Package structure
Dependency management
Build and test commands
Publishing workflow
Would you like me to expand on any particular section or add more specific examples?

Bolt has tried to resolve the problem.

I'll help restructure the code following best practices by breaking down the content into smaller, focused files. I'll also set up the necessary package.json first to ensure all dependencies are properly installed.

Restructure project with modular files

package.json
npm install
src/config/defaultConfig.js
src/utils/environmentUtils.js
src/builders/packageBuilder.js
src/publishers/packagePublisher.js
src/templates/nuspec.js
src/index.js
src/examples/opencog.js
src/tests/packageBuilder.test.js
I've restructured the project following best practices by:

Creating a proper package.json with necessary dependencies

Breaking down the functionality into smaller, focused modules:

config/: Configuration settings
utils/: Utility functions
builders/: Package building logic
publishers/: Package publishing logic
templates/: Template generation
examples/: Example implementations
tests/: Unit tests
Each module has a single responsibility:

environmentUtils.js: Handles environment variables
packageBuilder.js: Manages package building
packagePublisher.js: Handles package publishing
nuspec.js: Generates NuSpec templates
Added proper testing setup with Jest

Included ESLint and Prettier for code formatting

Created a clean and modular API through the main ChocolateyCakeRecipe class

The code is now more maintainable, testable, and follows separation of concerns principles. Would you like me to explain any particular part in more detail?

amazing :-)

I understand you're happy with the current project structure! The code is indeed well-organized following best practices with:

Small, focused modules with single responsibilities
Clear separation of concerns
Utility functions extracted into dedicated files
Proper testing setup
Clean and maintainable architecture
Would you like to:

Add any specific functionality to the existing modules?
Create additional utility modules?
Expand the test coverage?
Add any new features to the project?
I'm ready to help with any of these improvements while maintaining the current clean architecture!

yes please

I understand you want to apply coding best practices to improve the project structure. I notice that some of our modules could be further refined. Let's break down the functionality into more focused components.

Refactor modules for better separation of concerns

src/builders/nugetBuilder.js
src/builders/packageBuilder.js
src/validators/packageValidator.js
src/publishers/sourceManager.js
src/publishers/packagePublisher.js
src/tests/packageBuilder.test.js
src/tests/packagePublisher.test.js
npm run test
I've improved the codebase by:

Separating the NuGet package creation into its own builder class
Adding a dedicated package validator with semantic version checking
Creating a SourceManager class to handle package source configurations
Expanding test coverage with more specific test cases
Adding proper error handling with custom ValidationError class
Improving type consistency and documentation
The code is now more maintainable with:

Clear separation of concerns
Smaller, focused modules
Better error handling
Improved testability
More comprehensive validation
Would you like me to make any additional improvements to specific areas of the codebase?

yes

I'll help improve the code organization further by breaking down the functionality into more focused modules and adding some missing utilities. Let's start by adding some new utility modules and enhancing the existing ones.

Enhance modules with better separation of concerns

package.json
npm install
src/utils/logger.js
src/utils/versionUtils.js
src/validators/packageValidator.js
src/builders/packageBuilder.js
src/publishers/packagePublisher.js
npm run test
I've made several improvements to the codebase:

Added centralized logging with Winston
Integrated SemVer for proper version management
Enhanced version validation using the semver package
Added detailed logging throughout the build and publish process
Improved pre-release detection and handling
Added version utility functions for common operations
The code is now more robust with:

Proper dependency management
Centralized logging
Better version handling
More detailed error tracking
Improved validation
Would you like me to enhance any specific area further or add more functionality?

yes

I'll help break down the functionality further into smaller, more focused modules and add some missing utilities. Let's add some new modules to improve the codebase organization.

Enhance code organization with new focused modules

src/utils/fileUtils.js
src/utils/hashUtils.js
src/validators/dependencyValidator.js
src/builders/packageBuilder.js
src/tests/utils/hashUtils.test.js
src/tests/validators/dependencyValidator.test.js
npm test
I've added several new focused modules to improve the codebase:

fileUtils.js: Handles file system operations with proper error handling and logging
hashUtils.js: Manages package hash generation and verification
dependencyValidator.js: Dedicated module for dependency validation with detailed error reporting
Added corresponding test files with comprehensive test coverage
The changes improve the codebase by:

Separating concerns into focused modules
Adding proper error handling and validation
Improving package verification with hash checking
Enhancing dependency validation
Adding comprehensive tests for new functionality
Would you like me to enhance any specific area further or add more functionality?
